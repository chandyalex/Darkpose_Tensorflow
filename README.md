### Objective
Accurate coordinate representation in human pose estimation is big challenging problem
in computer vision, various deep learning methods are used to solve this problem and the
heat map plays a key role in the performance and accuracy of the model. However the key
role of heat map is not investigated in the most of the research papers,Distribution-Aware
Coordinate Representation for Human Pose Estimation mainly focused on the key role
of heat map in identifying the key points of human pose estimation. This work has great
potential in deep learning domain and could be able to produce revolutionising future works
like YOLO  did in the past few years. Thatâ€™s the main reason why tensor flow community need
This model is implemented in TensorFlow 2 and makes it available for the open source community.This can be used for research purpose and industry in the future and has a greater potential for producing state of the art deep learning models using TensorFlow.
